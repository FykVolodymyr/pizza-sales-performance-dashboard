📈 Key Insights: The data reveals a clear weekly seasonality, with sales gradually increasing throughout the week and peaking on Friday. The marketing team may consider introducing targeted promotions on days with the lowest sales to balance demand. A similar pattern is observed in the monthly trend, where September, October, and February appear to represent the "low season".

📈 Key Insights: The Top 5 sellers data shows that the highest revenue is not generated by the best-selling pizza. A closer price analysis may indicate that the Classic Deluxe Pizza is underpriced. Meanwhile, the Brie Carre Pizza ranks lowest in sales, falling significantly behind even within the bottom 5 bracket. This item may need to be reconsidered or removed from the menu.
